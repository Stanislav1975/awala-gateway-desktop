# Relaynet User Gateway for Windows, macOS and Linux

## Proof of concept implementation

This will be roughly the equivalent to implementing [`PoWebSocket/gateway.js`](https://github.com/relaynet/poc/blob/master/PoWebSocket/gateway.js) and then integrating it as it was done in [`user-gateway`](https://github.com/relaynet/poc/blob/master/bin/user-gateway) (note how `powebsocketGateway` is used).
